# Cloud Networking Explained: VPC Architecture Across AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI (2025 Guide)

*Cloud Networking • VPC • AWS • Azure • Google Cloud • Oracle Cloud*

## Why Cloud Networking Matters More Than Ever

Cloud networking is no longer just about IP ranges and subnets. It is the **foundation of security, scalability, hybrid connectivity, and cloud‑native architecture**.

Whether you are:
- Migrating workloads from on‑premises
- Designing a secure multi‑tier application
- Implementing hybrid or multi‑cloud strategies

A solid understanding of **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** design is essential.

This article covers:
- Core VPC concepts (cloud‑agnostic)
- How AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI implement networking
- A **side‑by‑side comparison table**
- **Provider‑specific architecture diagrams** using a single real‑world scenario

---

## What Is a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?

A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a logically isolated, software‑defined network within a public cloud that you fully control.

With a VPC, you can:
- Define private IP address ranges (CIDR)
- Segment workloads using subnets
- Control traffic routing
- Apply layered network security
- Connect securely to on‑premises or other clouds

> In practice, a VPC functions like your own private data center—without managing physical hardware.

## Core Cloud Networking Components (Universal Concepts)

All major cloud providers share the same foundational networking concepts:

| Component | Description |
|--------|------------|
| CIDR & IP Addressing | Private IPv4 / IPv6 address space |
| Subnets | Logical network segmentation |
| Route Tables | Control traffic flow |
| Internet Access | Internet Gateway & NAT |
| Firewalls | Stateful & stateless controls |
| Private Connectivity | Peering, VPN, Dedicated links |
| Observability | Flow logs and traffic monitoring |

## Real‑World Reference Architecture Used in This Article

**Scenario:**  
A secure, highly available **hybrid cloud web application** with:

- Public web tier
- Private application tier
- Private database tier
- Outbound internet via NAT
- On‑premises connectivity via VPN or dedicated connection

This same architecture is mapped consistently across all providers.

## AWS VPC – Reference Architecture

In AWS, a VPC is **regional** and spans multiple Availability Zones.

    Internet --> ALB[Application Load Balancer]
    ALB --> Web[Web Tier<br/>Public Subnet]

    Web --> App[App Tier<br/>Private Subnet]
    App --> DB[RDS / Database<br/>Private Subnet]

    App --> NAT[NAT Gateway]
    NAT --> IGW[Internet Gateway]
    IGW --> Internet

    OnPrem[On-Prem Data Center]
    OnPrem --> VPN[Site-to-Site VPN<br/>or Direct Connect]
    VPN --> VPC[AWS VPC]
```

**Key AWS Networking Services**
- VPC, Subnets (AZ‑specific)
- Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway
- Security Groups (stateful)
- Network ACLs (stateless)
- VPC Peering
- Site‑to‑Site VPN & Direct Connect

AWS networking is known for **maturity, granular security controls, and deep service integration**.

## Azure Virtual Network (VNet) – Reference Architecture

Azure networking is designed with **enterprise hybrid connectivity** as a first‑class feature.

```mermaid

    Internet --> AGW[Application Gateway]
    AGW --> Web[Web Tier<br/>Public Subnet]

    Web --> App[App Tier<br/>Private Subnet]
    App --> DB[Azure SQL / DB<br/>Private Subnet]

    App --> NAT[NAT Gateway]
    NAT --> Internet

    OnPrem[On-Prem Data Center]
    OnPrem --> VPN[VPN Gateway<br/>or ExpressRoute]
    VPN --> VNet[Azure VNet]
```

**Key Azure Networking Services**
- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- Azure Private Link
- User‑Defined Routes (UDR)
- VPN Gateway & ExpressRoute
- Azure Bastion
- VNet Peering

Azure excels in **hybrid networking and private access to PaaS services**.

## Google Cloud VPC – Global Network Architecture

Google Cloud uses a **global VPC model**, which is unique among major cloud providers.

```mermaid

    Internet --> GLB[Global HTTP(S)<br/>Load Balancer]
    GLB --> Web[Web Tier<br/>Regional Subnet]

    Web --> App[App Tier<br/>Regional Subnet]
    App --> DB[Cloud SQL / DB<br/>Private IP]

    App --> NAT[Cloud NAT]
    NAT --> Internet

    OnPrem[On-Prem Data Center]
    OnPrem --> VPN[HA VPN<br/>or Interconnect]
    VPN --> VPC[GCP Global VPC]
```

**Key GCP Networking Services**
- Global VPC
- Regional subnets
- Centralized firewall rules
- Cloud Router (BGP)
- Cloud NAT
- Shared VPC
- Private Google Access
- Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer

GCP stands out for **global scale, performance, and simplified network design**.

## Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) – VCN Architecture

OCI networking focuses on **performance, predictability, and enterprise workloads**.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Internet --> LB[OCI Load Balancer]
    LB --> Web[Web Tier<br/>Public Subnet]

    Web --> App[App Tier<br/>Private Subnet]
    App --> DB[Autonomous DB / DB<br/>Private Subnet]

    App --> NAT[NAT Gateway]
    NAT --> IGW[Internet Gateway]
    IGW --> Internet

    OnPrem[On-Prem Data Center]
    OnPrem --> VPN[VPN Connect<br/>or FastConnect]
    VPN --> DRG[Dynamic Routing Gateway]
    DRG --> VCN[OCI VCN]
```

**Key OCI Networking Services**
- Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)
- Internet & NAT Gateways
- Security Lists & Network Security Groups
- Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)
- Local & Remote Peering
- VPN Connect & FastConnect

OCI is well‑suited for **high‑performance and database‑centric architectures**.
