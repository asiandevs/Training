# Cloud Network Design Patterns: Hub‑Spoke and Landing Zones (Part 3)

*Cloud Architecture • Networking • Hub‑Spoke • Landing Zones • AWS • Azure • GCP • OCI*

---

## Why Network Design Patterns Matter in the Cloud

Most cloud networking failures are not caused by:
- Missing services
- Weak security tools
- Platform limitations  

They are caused by **poor network design choices made early**.

As environments grow, ad‑hoc VPCs and flat networks become:
- Hard to secure
- Hard to scale
- Hard to govern
- Expensive to fix

This article introduces **two foundational cloud network design patterns** used by enterprises at scale:

1. **Hub‑Spoke Architecture**
2. **Cloud Landing Zone Networking**

These patterns are **cloud‑agnostic** and apply equally to AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI.

---

## Cloud Network Design Goals (Architect View)

Before patterns, clarify the goals:

✅ Strong isolation between workloads  
✅ Centralized security and connectivity  
✅ Scalable onboarding of new environments  
✅ Consistent governance and compliance  
✅ Support for hybrid and multi‑cloud  

> **Architect rule:**  
> Network design must scale **organizationally**, not just technically.

## Pattern 1: Hub‑Spoke Architecture

### What Is Hub‑Spoke?

In a **Hub‑Spoke** model:
- A central **Hub network** provides shared services
- Multiple **Spoke networks** host workloads
- All traffic flows through the hub for inspection and control

---

### Hub‑Spoke Reference Architecture

```mermaid

    Internet --> HubFW[Central Firewall / WAF]
    HubFW --> HubLB[Shared Load Balancer]

    HubFW --> SpokeA[Spoke VPC A<br/>App Workloads]
    HubFW --> SpokeB[Spoke VPC B<br/>App Workloads]
    HubFW --> SpokeC[Spoke VPC C<br/>App Workloads]

    OnPrem[On-Prem Data Center]
    OnPrem --> Hybrid[VPN / Dedicated Link]
    Hybrid --> HubFW
```

---

### What Belongs in the Hub?

✅ Central firewalls  
✅ WAF and ingress controllers  
✅ NAT / egress inspection  
✅ DNS and directory services  
✅ Shared monitoring and logging  
✅ Hybrid connectivity (VPN / Direct Connect / ExpressRoute)

---

### What Belongs in the Spokes?

✅ Application workloads  
✅ Environment‑specific services  
✅ Minimal routing and firewall rules  
✅ No direct internet exposure (in mature setups)

---

### When to Use Hub‑Spoke

✅ Multiple applications or business units  
✅ Strong security and compliance requirements  
✅ Hybrid connectivity needed  
✅ Centralized network operations team  

---

### Hub‑Spoke: Pros and Cons

✅ **Pros**
- Centralized security
- Easier governance
- Predictable traffic flows
- Reduced duplication

⚠️ **Cons**
- Hub can become a bottleneck
- More complex routing
- Requires strong operational discipline

---

## Provider Mapping: Hub‑Spoke

| Provider | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| AWS | Transit VPC + TGW |
| Azure | Hub VNet + VNet Peering |
| GCP | Shared VPC / Hub Project |
| OCI | Hub VCN + DRG |

---

## Pattern 2: Cloud Landing Zone Networking

### What Is a Landing Zone?

A **Landing Zone** is a **pre‑configured, governed cloud environment** that provides:

- Standardized network architecture
- Security guardrails
- Identity and access controls
- Logging and monitoring
- Compliance alignment

Think of it as the **enterprise cloud foundation**.

---

## Landing Zone Network Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph LandingZone["Enterprise Landing Zone"]
        Hub[Connectivity & Security Hub]
        Mgmt[Management Network]
        Shared[Shared Services Network]
    end

    Hub --> Prod[Production Spokes]
    Hub --> NonProd[Non-Production Spokes]

    OnPrem --> Hybrid[VPN / Dedicated Link]
    Hybrid --> Hub
```

---

### Core Landing Zone Network Components

#### 1. Connectivity Hub
- Central ingress and egress
- Firewalls and WAF
- Hybrid connectivity
- Traffic inspection

#### 2. Management Network
- Bastion hosts
- Monitoring systems
- Backup and patching
- Security tooling

#### 3. Shared Services Network
- DNS
- Identity services
- Artifact repositories
- Internal APIs

#### 4. Workload Spokes
- Application‑specific VPCs/VNets
- Strong isolation
- Minimal shared dependencies

---

### Environment Isolation in Landing Zones

✅ Separate accounts/subscriptions/projects  
✅ Separate VPCs/VNets/VCNs  
✅ Separate IAM boundaries  
✅ Separate routing domains  

> **Architect rule:**  
> Environment isolation is non‑negotiable in regulated enterprises.

---

## Hub‑Spoke vs Landing Zone: Key Differences

| Aspect | Hub‑Spoke | Landing Zone |
|----|----|----|
| Scope | Network pattern | Enterprise foundation |
| Focus | Traffic control | Governance + security |
| Complexity | Medium | High |
| Scale | Team / BU level | Organization‑wide |
| Governance | Limited | Strong |
| Automation | Optional | Mandatory |

✅ **Most enterprises use both**  
Landing Zone = framework  
Hub‑Spoke = networking pattern inside it

---

## Advanced Design Considerations

### 1. Transitive Routing
- Control which spokes can talk to each other
- Avoid accidental full‑mesh connectivity
- Use route tables deliberately

### 2. Scaling Firewalls
- Design for throughput, not just rules
- Plan HA and failover
- Monitor saturation early

### 3. Multi‑Region Expansion
- Regional hubs
- Central policy enforcement
- Avoid single global choke points

---

## Common Architecture Mistakes ❌

❌ Single shared VPC for everything  
❌ No separation between Prod and Non‑Prod  
❌ Direct internet access from spokes  
❌ No central egress control  
❌ Manual network changes outside IaC  

These mistakes are **expensive to fix later**.

---

## Design Pattern Selection Guide

| Scenario | Recommended Pattern |
|------|---------------------|
| Small team / single app | Simple VPC |
| Multiple apps | Hub‑Spoke |
| Regulated enterprise | Landing Zone + Hub‑Spoke |
| Hybrid connectivity | Hub‑Spoke |
| Multi‑cloud | Landing Zone model |

---

## Final Thoughts

Cloud networking success is not about choosing the “right service” —  
it’s about choosing the **right pattern early**.

✅ Hub‑Spoke enables control and visibility  
✅ Landing Zones enable scale and governance  
✅ Together, they form the backbone of enterprise cloud adoption  

When designed correctly, these patterns:
- Reduce risk
- Accelerate delivery
- Enable security by default
