# Cloud Network Security Checklist (Cloud Architect Edition)

*AWS • Azure • Google Cloud • OCI • Zero Trust • VPC Security*

---

## Why This Checklist Exists

In the cloud, **network security failures are rarely caused by missing tools**.  
They are caused by **architectural decisions**.

As a Cloud Architect, your responsibility is not just to “make it work,” but to:
- Reduce blast radius
- Enforce explicit trust
- Prevent lateral movement
- Design for audit, scale, and failure

This checklist distills **real‑world cloud security architecture practices** into a **practical, provider‑agnostic guide** you can use during design reviews, landing zone builds, and pre‑production sign‑off.

---

## How to Use This Checklist

✅ Architecture design reviews  
✅ Landing zone validation  
✅ Pre‑production go‑live checks  
✅ Security and compliance assessments  
✅ Well‑Architected / CAF / NIST alignment  

> **Architect mindset:**  
> *Assume breach. Minimize impact. Log everything.*

---

## 1. Network Architecture & Segmentation ✅

### Environment Isolation
- ⬜ Separate **Production and Non‑Production** environments
- ⬜ Dedicated VPC / VNet / VCN per environment
- ⬜ CIDR ranges planned to avoid future overlap (hybrid, peering, multi‑cloud)

### Subnet Design
- ⬜ Public subnets used **only** for ingress components
- ⬜ Application and database tiers in **private subnets**
- ⬜ No flat networks across tiers
- ⬜ Routing between tiers explicitly defined

✅ **Architect Rule:**  
> If everything can talk to everything, the design is already compromised.

---

## 2. Ingress Security (North–South Traffic) ✅

- ⬜ Internet traffic terminates at **Load Balancer + WAF**
- ⬜ No public IPs on application or database workloads
- ⬜ TLS enforced with modern cipher suites
- ⬜ DDoS protection enabled using native services

**Provider Examples**
- AWS: ALB + WAF + Shield
- Azure: Application Gateway + WAF
- GCP: Global Load Balancer + Cloud Armor
- OCI: OCI Load Balancer + WAF

---

## 3. Firewall Strategy (Layered by Design) ✅

### Workload‑Level Firewalls (Primary Control)
- ⬜ Default **deny‑all** inbound rules
- ⬜ Only required ports explicitly allowed
- ⬜ Source restricted to known subnets or security groups
- ⬜ No `0.0.0.0/0` unless explicitly justified

### Subnet‑Level Controls (Secondary Control)
- ⬜ Used for coarse‑grained filtering only
- ⬜ Stateless rules documented and reviewed
- ⬜ Rule ordering tested

✅ **Architect Rule:**  
> Security Groups / NSGs first. Network ACLs second.

---

## 4. East–West Traffic (Lateral Movement Control) ✅

- ⬜ Explicit allow rules between tiers only
- ⬜ App tier cannot reach DB tier except required ports
- ⬜ No transitive trust across subnets
- ⬜ Sensitive workloads further isolated (micro‑segmentation where needed)

✅ **Goal:**  
Limit attacker movement after initial compromise.

---

## 5. Private Access to Cloud Services (Zero Public Exposure) ✅

- ⬜ All PaaS services accessed via **private endpoints**
- ⬜ Public service endpoints disabled
- ⬜ Private DNS resolution configured correctly
- ⬜ Traffic stays on provider backbone

**Provider Mapping**
- AWS: PrivateLink
- Azure: Private Link
- GCP: Private Google Access
- OCI: Service Gateway

✅ **Outcome:**  
No internet exposure, stronger compliance posture.

---

## 6. Egress Traffic Control (High‑Risk Area) ✅

- ⬜ No direct internet access from private workloads
- ⬜ Centralized NAT or firewall for outbound traffic
- ⬜ Egress allow‑listing implemented where feasible
- ⬜ TLS inspection considered (compliance permitting)
- ⬜ Outbound traffic logging enabled

✅ **Architect Rule:**  
> Most real‑world breaches involve outbound traffic. Treat egress as critical.

---

## 7. Hybrid Connectivity Security ✅

- ⬜ VPN tunnels encrypted using IPsec / IKEv2
- ⬜ Dedicated connections used for production workloads
- ⬜ Route filtering applied (no full route propagation)
- ⬜ Hybrid traffic separated from internet traffic
- ⬜ Connectivity paths documented and reviewed

**Recommended Order**
1. VPN (initial)
2. Dedicated link
3. VPN over dedicated link (highest security)

---

## 8. Identity‑Aware Networking (Zero Trust Alignment) ✅

- ⬜ No implicit trust based on network location
- ⬜ Identity‑based access where supported
- ⬜ Admin access via bastion / jump host only
- ⬜ MFA enforced for all privileged roles
- ⬜ No direct SSH/RDP from the internet

---

## 9. Logging, Monitoring & Visibility ✅

### Mandatory Logs
- ⬜ VPC / VNet / VCN Flow Logs enabled
- ⬜ Firewall logs enabled
- ⬜ Load balancer access logs enabled
- ⬜ VPN and gateway logs enabled

### Operational Readiness
- ⬜ Logs centralized in SIEM
- ⬜ Retention aligned with compliance
- ⬜ Alerts configured for anomalous traffic
- ⬜ Logging not disabled to reduce cost

✅ **Architect Rule:**  
> If you can’t see the traffic, you can’t secure it.

---

## 10. High Availability & Resilience ✅

- ⬜ Subnets span multiple AZs / fault domains
- ⬜ NAT, firewalls, and gateways are highly available
- ⬜ No single point of failure in traffic path
- ⬜ Failover tested—not assumed

---

## 11. Governance, Compliance & Drift Control ✅

- ⬜ Network design mapped to standards (ISO, NIST, CIS)
- ⬜ Guardrails enforced via policy (IaC / Policy‑as‑Code)
- ⬜ Configuration drift detection enabled
- ⬜ Periodic security architecture reviews scheduled

---

## 12. Architecture Red Flags (Fail Fast) ❌

❌ Flat network with no segmentation  
❌ Public IPs on databases  
❌ Overly permissive firewall rules  
❌ No egress controls  
❌ Logging disabled for cost savings  
❌ Manual changes outside Infrastructure as Code  

> Any one of these should **block production go‑live**.

---

## Executive Summary (Cloud Architect View)

✅ Cloud network security is **architecture‑driven**  
✅ Segmentation is non‑negotiable  
✅ Private access beats perimeter defense  
✅ Egress control is critical  
✅ Logging is a security feature, not an optional cost  

When designed correctly, **cloud networking can be more secure than traditional data centers**.
